# HyFactory

Uses my TrinexLib plugin as a dependency for power and item movement control

A factorization mod that I'm making for fun!

Current functions:
- Item pipes w/ configuration annd filters (smartly decides which inventory to put items in and take out of)
- Energy pipes
- Generic power generators, consumers, and storages for testing currently
